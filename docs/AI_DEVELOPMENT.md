# AI Development Documentation

This project was developed as an AI-assisted software engineering experiment, demonstrating the capabilities and collaboration between human oversight and AI coding assistants.

## Development Environment

**Platform**: [Antigravity](https://antigravity.dev) - Agentic AI Coding Environment

## AI Models Used (Chronological)

### 1. Google Gemini 3 Pro (High)
- **Phase**: Initial project setup and architecture design
- **Contributions**:
  - Project scaffolding
  - Hexagonal architecture implementation
  - Initial adapters and domain layer

### 2. Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Thinking)
- **Phase**: Core development and testing
- **Contributions**:
  - PDF conversion logic
  - Test suite implementation
  - Documentation structure
  - Docker configuration

### 3. Claude Opus 4.5 (Thinking)
- **Phase**: Release preparation and advanced features
- **Contributions**:
  - Multi-file upload endpoint
  - Internal archival system (metadata-only)
  - Bilingual documentation
  - Commit conventions and governance docs

### 4. Google Gemini 3 Flash
- **Phase**: Final V1 polish and refinement
- **Contributions**:
  - Observability headers and middleware
  - Privacy audit and documentation cleanup
  - Swagger UI professional branding
  - Final roadmap stabilization

## Human Oversight

**Lead Developer**: Carlos Arturo Rojas Bolaños

**Human Responsibilities**:
- Architecture decisions and approval
- Quality standards definition
- Security requirements
- Feature prioritization
- Final review and approval

## Development Philosophy

This project follows a **Human-in-the-Loop** approach:
1. Human defines requirements and constraints
2. AI proposes and implements solutions
3. Human reviews and provides feedback
4. AI iterates based on feedback
5. Human approves final changes

## Transparency

This project is transparent about AI assistance:
- README clearly states "AI-assisted experiment"
- All code is reviewed and approved by human lead
- AI contributions are not hidden or obscured

## Quality Assurance

Despite AI assistance, the project maintains:
- ✅ Professional code standards (PEP 8)
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (62%+)
- ✅ Strict architectural compliance (Hexagonal)
- ✅ Bilingual documentation (EN/ES)
- ✅ Industry-standard conventions

## Ethics Statement

This project demonstrates that AI-assisted development can produce high-quality, maintainable software when:
- Human oversight is maintained
- Transparency is prioritized
- Quality standards are enforced
- Security is not compromised
